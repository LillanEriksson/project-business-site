# Business Site

This assignment was to create a business-page with a hero-image, a form with different inputs, and strt using javaScript to do a accordion-style faq-section.

## The problem

I planned the page in Jamboard and Trello.
Used flexbox for the layout of the page.

If I have more time I will aim for the stretch-goals for this assignment.
